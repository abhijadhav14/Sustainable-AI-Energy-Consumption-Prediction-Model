# Sustainable AI Project - Final Report

## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive demonstration platform for sustainable AI principles and practices based on the concepts outlined in the "Sustainable AI" document. The platform showcases how AI can be developed and deployed with environmental, ethical, social, and economic sustainability at its core.

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-dimensional Sustainability Framework
The project implements a holistic approach to AI sustainability across four key dimensions:
- **Environmental Sustainability**: Energy-efficient computing, carbon footprint reduction
- **Ethical Governance**: Transparency, fairness, and accountability in AI systems
- **Social Sustainability**: Human-centered design, stakeholder engagement
- **Economic Sustainability**: Resource optimization, cost-efficiency

### 2. Sustainable AI Models
Domain-specific models with sustainability constraints:
- **Climate Forecasting**: Energy-efficient LSTM model for climate prediction
- **Energy Optimization**: Interpretable gradient boosting model for energy demand forecasting
- **Healthcare Access**: Fairness-aware classifier with bias mitigation for healthcare applications

### 3. Core Sustainability Tools
- **Sustainability Metrics**: Comprehensive framework for measuring energy consumption, carbon footprint, algorithmic fairness, and model interpretability
- **Ethical Validator**: Framework for ethical validation of AI systems focusing on transparency, fairness, and accountability
- **Sustainable Data Processing**: Data pipelines with bias detection and mitigation

### 4. Interactive Dashboard
A Flask-based web application that visualizes sustainability metrics and provides educational resources on sustainable AI practices.
