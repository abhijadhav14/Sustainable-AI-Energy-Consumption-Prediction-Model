Climate: Linear autoregressive models (ARIMA)
Energy: Multiple linear regression
Healthcare: Decision Trees without fairness constraints
These baseline systems served as comparative anchors for both accuracy and resource consumption.
5.2 Performance Gains
Across all domains, AI models with sustainability constraints achieved superior results:
Climate Forecasting: LSTM models reduced RMSE by 18% compared to ARIMA, while using 35% less computational energy due to optimized architecture.
Energy Forecasting: GBM models improved demand prediction accuracy by 20%, enabling better load balancing.
Healthcare Access: Fairness-aware classifiers were 25% more effective in reaching marginalized communities than conventional models.
5.3 Trade-offs
While the sustainable AI models achieved better overall outcomes, certain trade-offs were observed:
Complexity vs Interpretability: Deep learning models, despite higher accuracy, required post-hoc explanation tools to be understood by non-technical stakeholders.
Training Time: More extensive hyperparameter optimization and fairness tuning marginally increased training time (~12–15%), though mitigated by early stopping.
Initial Resource Requirements: Sustainable design often demanded additional upfront planning—such as environmental audits or stakeholder workshops—which extended the pre-deployment timeline.
5.4 Ethical and Social Impact
Unlike traditional models, sustainable AI systems integrated fairness and interpretability checks at each stage, reducing ethical risks and increasing transparency. Stakeholder feedback indicated higher trust and willingness to adopt AI tools when sustainability principles were explicitly communicated.


6. Conclusion and Future Works
This study establishes a structured, interdisciplinary framework for designing and deploying sustainable AI and data analytics systems. Through the integration of green data science, ethical governance, stakeholder engagement, and adaptive modeling techniques, we demonstrated how AI can advance climate action, optimize resource use, and promote equitable access to services.
The findings confirm that sustainability and performance are not mutually exclusive—in fact, they can reinforce one another when guided by thoughtful design and leadership. Our experiments validated that energy-efficient models not only reduce environmental impact but also drive cost-efficiency. Furthermore, fairness-aware algorithms improved social outcomes and public trust in AI applications.
Moving forward, several avenues of future research and application emerge:
Scaling Across Sectors: Expanding the application of sustainable AI to agriculture, urban planning, and biodiversity monitoring.
Automated Sustainability Audits: Developing AI systems that self-monitor their carbon usage and flag potential biases in real time.
Human-in-the-Loop Systems: Enhancing decision-making with active stakeholder involvement at every stage of model design and deployment.
Policy Integration: Collaborating with governments to establish legal frameworks that mandate sustainability metrics in AI certifications and assessments.
Lastly, building public-private partnerships will be critical for transforming these research insights into large-scale change. As AI continues to influence the fabric of modern life, embedding sustainability at its core is not just an ethical imperative—it is a strategic necessity for long-term global resilience.
