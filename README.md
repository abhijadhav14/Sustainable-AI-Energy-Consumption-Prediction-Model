```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sustainable-ai-project.git
cd sustainable-ai-project
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
- On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install dependencies:

## 💻 Usage

### Running the Dashboard

1. Navigate to the dashboard directory:
```bash
cd src/dashboard
```

2. Run the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```

3. Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5004/

### Using Core Modules

```python
# Example: Using the sustainability metrics
from src.core.sustainability_metrics import EnergyTracker, CarbonFootprintCalculator

# Initialize energy tracker
energy_tracker = EnergyTracker(device_type='cpu')

# Start tracking
energy_tracker.start_tracking()

# Run your model or computation
# ...

# Stop tracking and get metrics
metrics = energy_tracker.stop_tracking()
print(f"Energy consumption: {metrics['energy_consumption_kwh']} kWh")

# Calculate carbon footprint
calculator = CarbonFootprintCalculator(region='us', renewable_percentage=20)
footprint = calculator.calculate_carbon_footprint(metrics['energy_consumption_kwh'])
print(f"Carbon footprint: {footprint} kg CO2eq")
```

### Using Domain-Specific Models

```python
# Example: Using the climate model
from src.models.model_factory import ModelFactory
from src.models.climate.lstm_climate_model import LSTMClimateModel

# Create a model factory
factory = ModelFactory()

# Configure the model
config = {
    'input_dim': 5,
    'sequence_length': 24,
    'hidden_units': [64, 32],
    'dropout_rate': 0.2,
    'energy_efficiency_constraint': 0.7
}

# Create a climate model
model = factory.create_model('lstm_climate_model', config)

# Train and evaluate the model
# ...
